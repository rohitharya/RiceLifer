# Rice Lifer

India is the world's second-largest producer of rice and the largest exporter of rice in the world. Production increased from 53.6 million tons in FY 1980 to 120 million tons in FY2020-21

In India a study says that 30 percent of marginal and small farmers are still illiterate. 

Most farmers don't have proper exposure to the rice plant diseases, if these rice plants have been affected by such diseases then their money which is borrowed from landlords, and their efforts will totally wasted

So to assist them, we have an Developed Flutter Android App which will be helpful for farmers to identify the type of the rice diseases in their farm field by scanning their plant images using the android app in their Phone and also to find near-by Agricultural Shops to find Manures and fertilizers for proper cultivation. And also here the farmer could track the previous History of the rice crops classified.
